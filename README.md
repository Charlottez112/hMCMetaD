## Code for paper: Hybrid Monte Carlo Metadynamics

In paper, *Hybrid Monte Carlo Metadynamics*, we introduce a new algorithm that couples the Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm and Metadynamics, which we term "hMCMetaD".

* `algorithm` folder: implementation of hMCMetaD algorithm and an illustrative example on a double-well model system
* `updater` folder: implementation of hMCMetaD as a HOOMD-blue custom updater and an example of using hMCMetaD on a hard bipyramid system
